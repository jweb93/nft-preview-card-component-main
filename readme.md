## My process

### Roadmap

- Notion: https://www.notion.so/NFT-preview-card-component-b91e8ca02e89466799fee4d6480e7bab

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

```css
.card__img a:hover{
                background-color: var(--mid-cyan);
                background-image: url("/assets/icon-view.svg");
                background-repeat: no-repeat;
                background-size: scale-down;
                background-position: center;
            }
```

### Continued development

I learned how to add a little (background-size: scale-down;) icon (icon-view.svg) on the center of a hovered link block. I would like to know how to add more than one icon, with different sizes and positions in a hovered link.
